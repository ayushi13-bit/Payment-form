# Payment Form

This is a simple payment form created using HTML. It allows users to enter their contact and payment information, including name, gender, address, email, pincode, and card details. It is a mini-project that demonstrates basic form handling, input validation, and layout.

## Features

- **Contact Information**: Collects user name, gender, address, email, and pincode.
- **Payment Information**: Allows users to select a card type (Visa, Rupay, Mastercard), enter the card number, expiration date, and CVV.
- **Form Validation**: Some basic validation using HTML attributes like `required`, `type="email"`, `type="number"`, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to work on different screen sizes with basic styling (you can add your own CSS).

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the form.
- `style.css`: The external CSS file (you need to create and style it as per your requirements).

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the form.
3. Fill in the form and submit it (note that without backend logic, the form submission will not process any data).
